### Key considerations for using LSTM for sequential prediction:

1. Recurrent nets can model sequential data becuase the hidden state is affected by the input AND the previous hidden state.

2. A solution to the vanishing gradient problem is to use LSTM cells to remember long-term dependencies.

3. We can use LSTM networks for tie series data easily using Keras and Tensorflow.
